# Introduct the ravager

## Step 1
The villagers are scared of ravagers. Help them get over their bias by allowing them to meet the ravager. Use the Agent to lead it to each villager with an arrow above their head.

#### ~ tutorialhint 
Use the ``||hoc2020:lead ravager||`` block to have the ravager follow the Agent.

The ``||hoc2020:turn agent||`` block will turn the Agent either left or right.
